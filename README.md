inputformatter
==============

A formatter for web form input fields - can be used as an extension for validator.js or as stand-alone tool.

I am still working on creating the basic formatter for the initial commit. Until then, check out my JavaScript form validator: https://github.com/mosbymc/validator

The formatter was originally concieved to be a part of the validator itself, but due to the additional size and the amount of work required, it is now a stand-alone tool that can be used with or without validator.js
