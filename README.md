inputformatter
==============

A formatter for web form input fields - can be used as an extension for validator.js or as stand-alone tool.

I've committed the initial working version of formatter.js, however, there is still a lot of functionality to be added. The formatter.html file is a test page that I've made to test the functionality of the formatter as I build it. Currently the only inputs that are "hooked" into the formatter are the home and cell phone field. Both supply a different format for the field. Fell free to play around with it and try out different formats.

The formatter was originally concieved to be a part of the code in my other repo [validator.js](https://github.com/mosbymc/validator), but due to the additional size and the amount of work required, it is now a stand-alone tool that can be used with or without the validator. However, both are concieved to work similarly in that the use classes and attributes to drive the functionality. If you like the way to formatter works, be sure to check out the validator as well.
